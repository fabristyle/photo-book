a photo book generator
----------------------

this is a personal project i started in 2007 to generate a yearly photo book 
(as a 5x7" pdf) which i had printed by viovio http://viovio.com/

i described some of my motivation for the project here:
2007: http://justinsomnia.org/2008/01/the-making-of-a-photo-book/

i have used the code to generate photo books for each subsequent year:
2008: http://justinsomnia.org/2009/01/the-2008-photo-book/
2009: http://justinsomnia.org/2010/01/the-2009-photo-book/
2010: http://justinsomnia.org/2011/09/the-2010-photo-book/
2011: http://justinsomnia.org/2012/01/the-2011-photo-book/

in 2009 i significantly rewrote the layout code to add gutters and increase 
"safety" margins per viovio's pdf specs: http://www.viovio.com/wiki/PDF+Specs

this code is intended for illustrative purposes only, many of the layout details
are hardcoded, which suit my purposes just fine, but probably won't suit yours 
without significant modification.
